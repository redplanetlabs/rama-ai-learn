**Difficulty:** easy

## Problem

You are given a 0-indexed array nums of length n.
The distinct difference array of nums is an array diff of length n such that diff[i] is equal to the number of distinct elements in the suffix nums[i + 1, ..., n - 1] subtracted from the number of distinct elements in the prefix nums[0, ..., i].
Return the distinct difference array of nums.
Note that nums[i, ..., j] denotes the subarray of nums starting at index i and ending at index j inclusive. Particularly, if i > j then nums[i, ..., j] denotes an empty subarray.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [-3,-1,1,3,5]
Explanation: For index i = 0, there is 1 element in the prefix and 4 distinct elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[0] = 1 - 4 = -3.
For index i = 1, there are 2 distinct elements in the prefix and 3 distinct elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[1] = 2 - 3 = -1.
For index i = 2, there are 3 distinct elements in the prefix and 2 distinct elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[2] = 3 - 2 = 1.
For index i = 3, there are 4 distinct elements in the prefix and 1 distinct element in the suffix. Thus, diff[3] = 4 - 1 = 3.
For index i = 4, there are 5 distinct elements in the prefix and no elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[4] = 5 - 0 = 5.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,3,4,2]
Output: [-2,-1,0,2,3]
Explanation: For index i = 0, there is 1 element in the prefix and 3 distinct elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[0] = 1 - 3 = -2.
For index i = 1, there are 2 distinct elements in the prefix and 3 distinct elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[1] = 2 - 3 = -1.
For index i = 2, there are 2 distinct elements in the prefix and 2 distinct elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[2] = 2 - 2 = 0.
For index i = 3, there are 3 distinct elements in the prefix and 1 distinct element in the suffix. Thus, diff[3] = 3 - 1 = 2.
For index i = 4, there are 3 distinct elements in the prefix and no elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[4] = 3 - 0 = 3.

 
Constraints:

1 <= n == nums.length <= 50
1 <= nums[i] <= 50

## Contract

Implement a `deframafn` named `distinct-difference-array` in namespace `find-the-distinct-difference-array.solution`.

The function receives the problem arguments and returns the result.
Tests call it directly: `(distinct-difference-array arg1 arg2 ...)`

### Constraint

All computation must use Rama dataflow code. You may call existing
Clojure functions (e.g. `conj`, `count`, `inc`) but must not define any
local functions (`defn`, `fn`, `#()`).  This constraint is specific to
this challenge, and overrides the more general advice given in any
skills.

## Test Commands

- Public challenge tests: `clojure -X:test`
- Private verification tests (post-challenge): `clojure -X:test-private`

## File Location

Write your solution to:
```
implementations/find-the-distinct-difference-array/src/find_the_distinct_difference_array/solution.clj
```

## nREPL

Start an nREPL with the test classpath:

```bash
clj -M:nrepl
```
